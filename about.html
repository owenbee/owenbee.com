					Hi, I'm Owen. I run a menswear business called <a href="http://weartreats.com">Treats</a> I founded in 2013 to reinvent the Hawaiian shirt. Treats is based out of my apartment in San Francisco and my family's home in Los Angeles. I started Treats when I noticed guys wearing vintage Hawaiian shirts to concerts in 2012. I liked the shirts' leisure spirit, but disliked the shirts' baggy fit. I thought I could make them better, so I did and started a business. Today Treats is small but growing, and I've lined up exciting partnerships for 2016.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I grew up in a suburb of Los Angeles called Manhattan Beach, and moved north to attend <a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> for college. I graduated in 2012 with a BA in <a href="http://economics.stanford.edu/">Economics</a> and a coterminal MA in <a href="https://ceas.stanford.edu/">East Asian Studies</a>. I studied Economics because I was good at the intro courses and didn't know what else to major in; East Asian Studies because I was interested in China. I speak solid Mandarin for a westerner, though my Chinese is not as <span class="italic">haobang</span> today as it was when I lived in Beijing and Shenzhen.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					After Stanford I briefly worked in finance, but left because I wound up in a miserable job I didn't sign for. It's a long and uninteresting story. I then consulted for a LED lamp manufacturer called <a href="http://greenrayled.com/">Greenray</a> in Shenzhen, China while I was getting Treats off the ground. Treats has been my first real job in a lot of ways, and I've learned solo entrepreneurship isn't my cup of tea, so I'm grateful for my family, friends, and <a href="http://startx.stanford.edu/">Stanford's StartX</a> program for helping make my business a modest success.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Recently I've become increasingly interested in technology. I love fashion because it's such a powerful and convenient form of self-expression. But I wish I had a bigger impact on the world, and in my opinion, technology is a better lever to create impact than fashion. So I'm slowly building technical chops &mdash; I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make this website for example &mdash; and I hope whatever I do after or alongside Treats relates to technology.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Outside of work, I read, hike, camp, bike, and box. I just started taking Muay Thai lessons, plus Jiu Jitsu for my ground game. So if you've ever wanted to punch me, holler and we can take a lesson together.
